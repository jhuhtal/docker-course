The project is a Python library for utilizing an Apache Spark JAR package from Python environment.

I used Docker for running unit tests with Pytest. The Dockerfile is based on python:30-slim image and 
includes commands for installing JDK and Poetry as well as commands for installing Python dependencies 
(python, pyspark, py4j, unidecode, numpy, pytest, pytest-watch) using Poetry. The container is run 
with the following command:

docker run --rm -ti -v "$(PWD):/project:ro" <image-name>
